# Brick_Breaker

This program is a copy of the Atari game Breakout, where you bounce a ball off a paddle to break blocks. There are two levels, a menu, and a game over screen. When the ball hits the bottom of the screen you get a game over, clear the screen of blocks to move onto the next level.

## Planning

I started this program by planning out with my classmates what the minimum a game like breakout needed to work, which when minimized, was just blocks that do different things, such as a ball, the paddle, and the clearable blocks. I then created a flowchart for how the program would work.

Later, I thought of what each object needed like the blocks needing a width, height, and position.
